# Cloud-Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?
* Cloud Computing is an **on-demand delivery** of compute, storage, database, networking, and many more services over the internet.
* On-demand delivery means **you get it** when you need it.
* It comes with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

## What are the different cloud computing services?
* Compute
* Storage
* Database
* Networking

### Compute
* Compute is the processing power of a macine

### Storage
* Storage enables you to **save data** within a data storage services.
* You can store data such as a video, music, documents, pictures etc.
* Data saved on a storage device will remain **permanently** untill you delete it
* To store data either temporarily or permanently on the cloud, you can use **cloud storage**.

### Database
* When you arrange your data or information in certain rows and columns, it is called **structured data**
* To store ahuge amount of data, you need a special type of storage device called databases.
* MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
* To store structured data in cloud, you use a **database**

### Networking
* It is a service that provide **connectivity** among different services.

## Cloud Deployment Models
### Why do we need Cloud Deployment Models?
* Different organisations have different requirements, they want different levels of control on their cloud infrastructure.
* Each cloud deployment model offers a different of **management, security**, and **cost**.

### 3 Types of Cloud Deployment Models
#### 1.Public Cloud
* A public cloud is cloud computing infrastructure maintained and operated by a **cloud service provider**
* **Anyone** can use the public cloud.
* The cloud service providers are responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure.

#### 2.Private Cloud
* A private cloud is a cloud computing infrastructure that is **specially provisioned** for a comapany.
* Cloud service are available to an **organisation** and its **users** only.
* The physical infrastructure can be maintained either **by the organisation** itself or **by third party** who is providing the cloud services.

#### 3.Private Cloud
* When a cloud computing infrastructure is available for a certain organistaion and to their internal people only, this is called Private Cloud.
* Private clouds are **more expensive** than public clouds.
* Private clouds are used by organisations that want to run their mission-critical applications due to **security reasons**.

## Key Concepts of Cloud
1. Scalability (vertical and Horizontal scaling)
2. Elasticity
3. Agility
4. High Availability
5. Fault Tolerance 

**Scalability**
* Scalability is the ability of system to scale, in this case scaling is the process of increasing or decreasing the compute power.

**Elasticity**
* If the system can scale automatically, it is known as**Automatic Scaling**.
* Elasticity is the ability of the system to scale dynamically.

**Agility**
* The ability of system to **react quickly**

**High Availability**
* It is the ability of a system to **operate continuously without failure** for a designated period.

**Fault Tolerance**
* Tolerance means the ability of a virtual machine to **remain up** and service failures.
* A fault-tolerance system takes care of any failure, repairs it, and keeps the application running.
* Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, storage etc) to **continue operating without interruption** whwn one or more of its componets fail.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
### Trade fixed expense for variable expense
**CAPEX**
* The upfront investment in acquiring the physical space, hardware,and staff to set up a data centre is called CAPEX, capital expense or fixed expense.

**OPEX**
* The upfront investment in a technical team to keep the data centre running is known as OPEX, Operational expense pr variable expense
